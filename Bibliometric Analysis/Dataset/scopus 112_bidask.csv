The problem is mathematically formulated as an optimization problem where the variance of the portfolio is perceived as a risk. The task is to find the portfolio which has a satisfactory return but has the minimum variance. The underlying is modeled by a variance gamma process which can explain the extreme price movement of the asset. We also study how the optimized portfolio changes subject to a user’s views of the future asset price. Moreover, the optimization model is extended for asset pricing and hedging. To illustrate the technique, we compute indifference prices for buying and selling six options namely a European call option, a quadratic option, a sine option, a butterfly spread option, a digital option, and a log option, and propose the hedging portfolios, which are the portfolios one needs to hold to minimize risk from selling or buying such options, for all the options. The sensitivity of the price from modeling parameters is also investigated. Our hedging strategies are decent with the symmetry property of the kernel density estimation of the portfolio payout. The payouts of the hedging portfolios are very close to those of the bought or sold options. The results shown in this study are just illustrations of the techniques. The approach can also be used for other derivatives products with known payoffs in other financial markets. © 2023 by the authors.","exotic option; indifference pricing; mean-variance utility; S&P 500; variance gamma",,"Rakwongwan, U.; Department of Mathematics, Thailand; email: udomsak.ra@ku.th",,"MDPI",20793197,,,,"English","Computation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85148614175

Using data from Taiwan whose audit reports are required to be signed by audit partners and controlling for the endogenous auditor choice, the results show that the audit partner industry specialization moderates the positive relation between discretionary accruals and measures of information asymmetry (i.e., bid-ask spread and analyst forecast dispersion). Moreover, this positive relation is stronger for firms whose audit partners are industry specialists than for firms whose audit firms are industry specialists. Further analysis shows that the first audit partner’s expertise itself matters more for the association between earnings quality and information asymmetry, in comparison with the expertise of audit firm alone. The results are robust to alternative estimation method and models, and alternative measures of information asymmetry, earnings quality, and industry specialists. Overall, the evidence is consistent with the audit partner’s industry specialization reducing information asymmetry via its impact on higher earnings quality.

Motivated by the PCAOB's concern, this paper investigates whether audit quality of fair value measurements has information value to investors. Using a sample of U.S. public banks during 2008–2019, I find a significantly positive (negative) association between stock prices (bid-ask spreads) and the perceived audit quality of fair value estimates. This finding is consistent with investors valuing audit quality as it enhances the reliability of—and reduces the uncertainty associated with—complex estimates. Furthermore, using the fair value hierarchy mandated by SFAS 157, Fair Value Measurement, I find the incremental valuation effect of the perceived audit quality is greater for the substantial estimation uncertainties and potential management bias inherent in Level 3 fair value assets. In addition, I find some evidence that an auditor's banking industry expertise plays a more significant role than Big 4 status in investors' perceptions of audit quality with respect to FVM. Additional cross-sectional results reveal that the documented effect is greater for banks with declining capital adequacy and for smaller banks. Collectively, my findings suggest that perceived audit quality is important to investors in assessing the informativeness of complex fair value measurements. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","ASC 820; Audit quality; Fair value measurements; SFAS 157",,,,"Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.",08826110,,,,"English","Adv.

Asymmetric information influences stock prices with varying degree of investors’ perception. Estimation of asymmetric information cost and its determinants have been explored significantly under low-frequency trading. The literature hardly attempts to study asymmetric information cost under high-frequency trading (HFT). Asymmetric information cost significantly influences bid-ask spread, and hence the nature of its impact under different market conditions needs to be analyzed under HFT. The study attempts to estimate asymmetric information cost in HFT and analyze its determinants under different industry sectors and market conditions. The study followed Affleck-Graves et al. (1994, The Journal of Finance, 49(4), 1471–1488) model to estimate the asymmetric information cost using 5 minutes interval data for a period of 82 trading days. Information gets reflected in equity through the movement in price, variation in trading volume, and return volatility. The study has found share price, traded volume, return volatility and trading frequency as the major determinants of asymmetric information cost in different market conditions.

Specifically, we examine the influence of one of the most important corporate governance mechanisms, board structure, on the stock market liquidity of listed banks in Saudi Arabia. We mainly concentrate on four characteristics of board structure: board size, board independence, board meetings and board busyness, and their impact on bid–ask spread, trading volume, turnover ratio and number of trades (employed as proxies of stock liquidity). This study employs a pooled ordinary least squares (OLS) model to investigate this relationship. Furthermore, we use a lag approach and the generalized method of moments (GMM) estimation to test for endogeneity issues. The findings of the two models are the same as the main estimation model of the OLS. Using a sample of 108 observations representing all banks listed on the Saudi Stock Market (TASI) from 2010 to 2020, we find a positive and significant association between board size and board independence with stock liquidity. However, board busyness is negatively associated with stock liquidity. Furthermore, we examine the relationship between board structure and agency problems. The results show that board size and board independence reduce agency problems, whereas board busyness increases agency problems.

One of the challenges in TCA is to build a realistic benchmark for the expected transaction cost and to characterize the price impact of each individual trade with given bond characteristics and market conditions. Taking the viewpoint of retail investors, this paper presents an analytical methodology for TCA of corporate bond trading. Our analysis is based on the TRACE Enhanced dataset; and starts with estimating the initiator of a bond transaction, followed by estimating the bid-ask spread and the mid-price dynamics. With these estimations, the first part of our study is to identify key features for corporate bonds and to compute the expected average trading cost. This part is on the time scale of weekly transactions, and is by applying and comparing several regularized regression models. The second part of our study is using the estimated mid-price dynamics to investigate the amplitude of its price impact and the decay pattern of individual bond transaction. This part is on the time scale of each transaction of liquid corporate bonds, and is by applying a transient impact model to estimate the price impact kernel using a non-parametric method. Our benchmark model allows for identifying abnormal transactions and for enhancing counter-party selections. A key discovery of our study is the price impact asymmetry between customer-buy orders and consumer-sell orders. © 2022 The Author(s).

The excitation kernel of the counting process depends on the state process that, reciprocally, switches state when there is an event in the counting process. We first establish the existence and uniqueness of state-dependent Hawkes processes and explain how they can be simulated. Then we develop maximum likelihood estimation methodology for parametric specifications of the process. We apply state-dependent Hawkes processes to high-frequency limit order book data, allowing us to build a novel model that captures the feedback loop between the order flow and the shape of the limit order book. We estimate two specifications of the model, using the bid–ask spread and the queue imbalance as state variables, and find that excitation effects in the order flow are strongly state-dependent.

Modern and sophisticated methods are used but their credibility suffered due to the financial crisis in 2007–2010. Instead, a method based on a standard semiparametric smoothing is proposed and the overall complexity and robustness (with respect to various anomalies, such as bid-ask spreads, discrete ticks in price, non-synchronous trading, or even heavy tailed error distributions) is achieved by using the conditional quantile estimation. The overestimation and the sparsity principle are adopted to introduce additional flexibility and the LASSO-type penalty and the set of well-defined linear constraints are employed to produce the final estimate which complies with the arbitrage-free criteria dictated by the financial theory. The theoretical results of the model are discussed, finite sample properties are investigated via a simulation study and a practical application of the proposed method is illustrated for the Apple Inc.

It has wide applications in risk management, asset pricing, and asset allocation. In recent years, extreme volatilities occurred in the Chinese financial market from time to time. For example, during 2014-2015, the Chinese stock market underwent extreme market conditions: the stock market sharp rally was followed by a sharp plunged, which eventually evolved into a crash. In particular, the abnormal volatilities from June to August in 2015 caused investors and regulators to concern about financial risks. Existing volatility modeling methodologies are largely based on low-frequency data. The most widely used models include GARCH and stochastic volatility (SV) models. Although these models can capture the main characteristics of financial market volatility, they are subject to a few limitations. First, these models are parametric in spirit and thus may suffer from model misspecification. Second, these models only use low frequency returns to estimate and forecast volatility without considering intraday sample information. The estimates may be biased, leading to nontrivial forecast errors. Last, the parametric estimation procedure for these models remains very complicated, especially for the SV model. In the multivariate case, these models are constantly challenged by the curse of dimensionality, and therefore are of limited use in real applications. Recently, with easier access to high-frequency data and the rise of high frequency trading, an increasing number of studies begin to use high-frequency data to estimate, model and predict volatility. One of the most famous proxy variables for volatility is so-called realized volatility (RV). RV has several merits: it is nonparametric and thus requires less assumptions on model set-up. As a matter of fact, it only imposes the assumption of no arbitrage opportunities. Besides, RV is a direct proxy for volatility, it is not necessary to obtain the embedded volatility like the GARCH model. Last but not least, many studies find the forecasting performance of the simple time series model for RV can beat the GARCH model. However, there are several challenges when using high frequency data to estimate volatility. First, many studies show that jump should be included in asset prices. In the presence of jumps, RV is indeed an estimation of the sum of continuous volatility (CV) and jump volatility (JV). Since CV and JV represent different types of risk, it is necessary to disentangle them from each other in real applications. Two most famous estimations for CV are the multipower estimation and truncated realized variance estimation. Second, the observed high-frequency prices are usually contaminated by noise due to but not limited to bid-ask spread, information asymmetry, discreetness of price, etc. Under these scenarios, RV is no longer a consistent estimation of CV, and the size of bias determinates as the sampling frequency increases. There are several ways to alleviate the effects of noise when estimating CV. One common strategy is using the subsampling method, which, however, will lead to information loss. Other methodologies include the two-scale realized variance (TSRV) or multiscale realized variance (MSRV) estimation, the realized kernel estimation, the pre-averaging method, the quasi maximum likelihood estimation (QMLE), and the local moment estimation (LMM), etc. But most of them assume that noise process is independent of the underlying asset price and serially independent. For example, the TSRV (MSRV) and QMLE estimation assume that noise is i. i. d., while the pre-averaging method assumes that noise is conditionally independent. However, empirical studies reveal that noise is time varying, dependent and correlated with the underlying asset price. These stylized facts are much more complicated than the assumptions underlie the models. Therefore, it is important to improve the accuracy of volatility measurement, as well as to separate noise variance, CV and JV from noisy high frequency data. By doing so, we can improve the management of volatility and market risk surveillance. In view of these facts, this paper extends the pre-averaged threshold realized variance estimator for integrated volatility in Jing, et al[1] to the case with time-varying conditional variance of market microstructure noise and jumps. By using pre-averaging and threshold technique, we can remove the microstructure noise and jumps, respectively. The asymptotic properties of this new estimator, including the consistency and associated central limit theorems, are also provided. Monte Carlo simulations show that the estimator is robust to both microstructure noise and Levy jumps, and it provides less biased estimation, compared with existing estimators, of continuous variations in finite samples. We also illustrate, through Monte Carlo simulations, how the choice of threshold and preaveraging parameters, as well as noise with time-varying conditional variance (e. g. the moving average noise, rounding noise and dependent noise) affect the CV estimation. In the empirical analysis part, we use the improved pre-averaged threshold realized variance estimation on the Level-2 high frequency data for SSE 50 component stocks from 2014 to 2015. We separate noise variance, jump volatility and continuous volatility and study the relationships among these volatilities using panel vector autoregressive models. Then, we investigate the predictive power of noise variance on CV and JV using the extended HAR models. The main findings are summarized as follows. There exists bidirectional Granger causality between noise variance and CV. Both CV and noise variance Grangercause JV, but not vice versa. Noise variance has positive predictive power for underlying return volatility, and such predictability holds for both CV and JV, especially for the former. © 2021.

In other words, this approach is applied to analyse the target pricing model through transaction costs proxy and evaluation of the portfolios.

Design/Methodology/Approach: This paper uses archival data retrieved from firms listed on the Tehran Stock Exchange from 2004 to 2017. The static and dynamic panel data approaches are used for analysis. Research findings: Results show that an increase in information asymmetry increases firms’ leverage deviation. Results also indicate that firms with a higher (lower) level of information asymmetry tend to adjust their actual leverage towards the target, slower (faster) than that of other firms. These results are robust when using different sample periods, alternative set of leverage determinants and various estimation methods. Theoretical contribution/Originality: This study investigates the effect of information asymmetry on leverage deviation and leverage adjustment speed in an emerging market. The results offer insights into the theoretical framework showing the relationship between the transparency of the business environment and capital structure. Practitioner/Policy implication: The result derived from the current study should be of interest to board of directors and policymakers. The findings are significant because more transparent firms may be more successful in achieving the optimal leverage, consequently lowering the capital cost. Research limitation/Implications: One limitation of the study is that the measures used for information asymmetry are based on the bid– ask spread, and the probability of informed trading. These measures may not completely reflect all of the information asymmetry among market participants.

The purpose of this study is to examine the impact of trading characteristics (price, trading volume, variability, return volatility, absolute stock return, and Beedles thin trading measure) on liquidity measures (Amihud illiquidity ratio, return reversal measure, stock turnover, zero return, turnover-volatility ratio and proportional bid-ask spread) in Tehran Stock Exchange. We extend previous studies by combining different liquidity measures using TOPSIS technique and by employing a multidimensional variable, namely TOPSIS output. Results reveal both of the liquidity measures are strongly related to trading characteristics including stock turnover and zero return. Also, stock price, trading volume, and Beedles thin trading measures are the most significant factors in estimating liquidity. Different effects of different liquidity measures indicate that liquidity is a multidimensional and complex concept, and each measure reflects only one aspect of liquidity. The results of examining the influence of trading characteristics on the combined (multidimensional) liquidity measure indicate that trading characteristics are the main determinants of liquidity.

It also briefly illustrates the advantages of such an approach using real data. Design/methodology/approach: The paper uses an infinite dimensional (functional space) approach to inverse problems. Numerical computations are carried out using a Markov Chain Monte-Carlo algorithm with several tweaks to ensure good performance. The model explicitly uses bid-ask spreads to allow for observation errors and provides automatic smoothing based on them. Findings: A non-parametric framework allows to capture complex shapes of zero-coupon yield curves typical for emerging markets. Bayesian approach allows to assess the precision of estimates, which is crucial for some applications. Examples of estimation results are reported for three different bond markets: liquid (German), medium liquidity (Chinese) and illiquid (Russian). Practical implications: The result shows that infinite-dimensional Bayesian approach to term structure estimation is feasible. Market practitioners could use this approach to gain more insight into interest rates term structure. For example, they could now be able to complement their non-parametric term structure estimates with Bayesian confidence intervals, which would allow them to assess statistical significance of their results. Originality/value: The model does not require parameter tuning during estimation. It has its own parameters, but they are to be selected during model setup. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Bayesian approach; Bond pricing; Infinite-dimensional Bayesian inverse problems; Markov Chain Monte-Carlo; Regularization; Term structure fitting",,"Lapshin, V.; School of Finance, Russian Federation; email: vlapshin@hse.ru",,"Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.",10867376,,,,"English","Stud.

Although investors' beliefs are usually unobservable, this study develops a new approach to estimate investors beliefs. Following well-established rational learning and market microstructure models, it is assumed that informed traders submit market orders according to their beliefs, whereas market makers/uninformed traders make Bayesian inferences about the informed traders' private signals after observing the total order flows. By fitting intraday transaction data to this model, we can estimate the daily belief uncertainties of informed and uninformed investors; this estimation is performed on S & P 500 stocks. The belief parameters estimated by this approach have incremental explanatory power to bid-ask spreads. The findings show that market makers' belief uncertainty plays a more important role in determining sustainable stock returns than informed traders'. Implications of these findings include: (a) the larger market maker group is influencing the market trends; (b) this dominant group is making decisions based on diverse types of data; and (c) increased understanding of the diversity of belief parameters may facilitate strategies to enhance sustainable returns, however, stock trading is still significantly influenced by emotive factors worthy of further research. © 2019 by the authors.","Information asymmetry; Investors' beliefs; Liquidity; Stock returns; Stock trading","assessment method; decision making; economic growth; stock market; strategic approach; sustainability","Yue, X.-G.; Rattanakosin International College of Creative Entrepreneurship, Thailand; email: xgyue@foxmail.com",,"MDPI",20711050,,,,"English","Sustainability",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073942031

This study utilized the financial data of 45 corporations that had exercised stock splits on Bursa Malaysia from the years 2011 to 2015. The dependent variables were cumulative abnormal return for 40 days, cumulative abnormal return for 60 days, and the split factor. The independent variables, dividends per share and earnings per share, represent the signalling hypothesis for the stocks in Malaysia, while the bid-ask spread and the trading volume represent the liquidity hypothesis and the market capitalization, respectively. The significance of abnormal returns surrounding stock split announcements was tested using standardized t-statistics. The determinants of cumulative abnormal return and the split factor were determined based on Ordinary Least-Squares (OLS) multivariate regression and Stepwise Least-Squares. The empirical results show that there was a statistically significant positive abnormal return on day 1 [+1] after the stock split announcements. Dividend per share was found to have a statistically significant relationship with the cumulative abnormal return; thus supporting the signalling hypothesis. Bid-ask spread and trading volume were the main determinants of cumulative abnormal return, supporting the liquidity hypothesis under a different estimation window. Bid-ask spread was the only important determinant for the split factor.

We address this challenge by introducing two low frequency bid-ask spread estimators using daily high and low transaction prices. The range of mid-prices is an increasing function of the sampling interval, while the bid-ask spread and the relationship between trading direction and the mid-price are not constrained by it and are therefore independent. Monte Carlo simulations and data analysis from the equity and foreign exchange markets demonstrate that these models (especially SHL2) significantly out-perform the most widely used low-frequency estimators, such as those proposed in Corwin and Schultz (2012) and most recently in Abdi and Ronaldo (2017). Using real world data we show that one of our estimators (SHL2)’s root mean square error (RMSE) is almost less than a half (even 20%) of the competitors. We illustrate how our models can be applied to deduce historical market liquidity in US, UK, Hong Kong and the Thai stock markets.

We implement alternative realized covariance estimators based on intraday returns sampled at alternative frequencies and obtain their dynamic versions using a multivariate GARCH framework.

In addition, the paper investigates whether the influence of IFSB-4 on information asymmetry varies between Islamic and conventional financial institutions. Design/methodology/approach: The paper tests the hypotheses using a sample of firms listed in the GCC over a period of 2000-2013. Ordinary least square regression and fixed-effects estimation techniques are applied to test the hypotheses. Findings: The findings reveal that information asymmetry among investors is lower after the implementation of IFSB-4 than before, indicating that the standard has increased transparency. The results also reveal that information asymmetry after the implementation of IFSB-4 is lower for Islamic than for conventional financial institutions. This suggests that IFAB-4 promotes more transparency for Islamic than conventional institutions. Research limitations/implications: Owing to data availability, we were unable to use other proxies of information asymmetry, e.g. bid-ask spreads, and the level of disclosure, e.g. self-constructed disclosure index. Practical implications: The paper concludes that disclosures under IFAB-4 reduce information asymmetry among investors. In this context, this study increases the awareness of standard setters academics investors regulators and many other stakeholders about the economic consequences of disclosure standards in the region. Originality/value: This study takes a first step to fill evident gaps in the literature by investigating the influences of disclosure standard on information asymmetry in a unique setting that is often ignored by accounting researchers, which helps to widen our knowledge on accounting practices across the globe. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Disclosure; Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC); IFAB-4; Information asymmetry; Islamic accounting standards; Islamic financial institutions",,"Tessema, A.M.; Department of Accounting, United Arab Emirates; email: abiot.tessema@zu.ac.ae",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",17538394,,,,"English","Int.

When the trade direction is known, any estimate of the spread is associated with a unique series of conjectural mid-prices derived by adjusting the observed transaction price by half the estimated spread. It is shown that the covariance of successive conjectural mid-price returns is maximised (or least negative) when the estimated spread is equal to the true spread. A search procedure to maximise this covariance may therefore be used to estimate the true spread. The performance of this estimator under various conditions is examined both theoretically and with Monte Carlo simulations. The simulations confirm the theoretical results.

However, it is not easy to obtain a well-behaved RND due to the data limitations, the complex constraints and the ill-posedness of the problem. In this paper, we propose a more effective nonparametric method for estimating the RND from a set of European option bid-ask quotes based on a Linear Programming Support Vector Regression (LPSVR). The method allows us to fit beyond the range of data and to incorporate all the shape constraints, and it thus always gives an arbitrage-free density with full tails. In addition, the method does not need preprocessing of the data and is robust to the bid-ask spread. The Monte-Carlo simulations and the empirical tests have been carried out to demonstrate the excellent accuracy and stability of the method. The results show that the LPSVR method is a promising alternative for estimating the RND. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The Corwin-Schultz estimator arises as an easy way to compute asymmetric information throughout daily high and low stock prices for estimating overnight and non-negative adjusted spreads. The sample consisted of Ibovespa firms from 1986 to 2014 and was analysed with time series econometrics. The findings show that the measures of spread have stationarity properties, allowing for forecasting in a period of lagged variables, besides having the property of time-varying cointegration with market-to-book ratio, debt on equity, size and return and also presenting sensibility to different periods, industries and listing segments. Thus, the Corwin-Schultz bid-ask spread estimator seems to be a valid and reliable measure for forecasting aggregate-data variables through the weighted average of firm-level variables. © 2016, ANPAD - Associacao Nacional de Pos-Graduacao e Pesquisa em Administracao.

The bid-ask spread is important for many reasons. Because spread data are not always available, many methods have been suggested for estimating the spread. Existing papers focus on the performance of the estimators either under ideal conditions or in real data. The gap between ideal conditions and the properties of real data are usually ignored. The consistency of the estimates across various sampling frequencies is also ignored. Design/methodology/approach: The estimators and the possible errors are analysed theoretically. Then we perform simulation experiments, reporting the bias, standard deviation and root mean square estimation error of each estimator. More specifically, we assess the effects of the following factors on the performance of the estimators: the magnitude of the spread relative to returns volatility, randomly varying of spreads, the autocorrelation of mid-price returns and mid-price changes caused by trade directions and feedback trading. Findings: The best estimates come from using the highest frequency of data available. The relative performance of estimators can vary quite markedly with the sampling frequency. In small samples, the standard deviation can be more important to the estimation error than bias; in large samples, the opposite tends to be true. Originality/value: There is a conspicuous lack of simulation evidence on the comparative performance of different estimators of the spread under the less than ideal conditions that are typical of real-world data.

We find that in European stock markets discretionary accruals are positively related with the Corwin and Schultz high-low spread estimator used as a proxy for information asymmetry. Our results suggest that the earnings management component of accruals outweighs the informational component, but the significance of the relation varies across countries. Further, such association tends to be stronger for firms with the highest levels of positive discretionary accruals.

The paper focusses on whether the new measure as a liquidity proxy commands a significant premium. The research helps the understanding on the validity of the Corwin-Schultz estimate as a liquidity measure. Design/methodology/approach – The authors carry out their examination based on the portfolio approach, cross-sectional regressions, and time-series regressions. For comparison, the authors also adopt other three liquidity proxies and mainly rely on the Fama-French three-factor model as the benchmark. The sample includes NYSE/AMEX/ARCA/NASDAQ ordinary common stocks over 1926-2010. Findings – The paper finds that Corwin-Schultz spread lacks significant power to predict returns either in the pre- or post-1963 period. In contrast, other liquidity measures such as the price impact of Amihud (2002), trading discontinuity of Liu (2006), and turnover show stronger return predictability than the Corwin-Schultz spread estimate. Research limitations/implications – The evidence indicates the limited ability of the Corwin-Schultz spread estimate to describe liquidity. Practical implications – The comparison of the Corwin-Schultz spread with other liquidity measures helps practitioners and academic researchers to identify the appropriate proxy. Originality/value – This paper, for the first time, provides a thorough assessment of the Corwin-Schultz spread estimate as a liquidity proxy, which distinguish from Corwin and Schultz (2012) who focus on whether their spread estimate measures transaction costs. Our study not only helps practitioners and academic researchers to select an adequate liquidity measure and an asset pricing model to use, but it also sheds light on the current debate about whether transaction costs have the first order importance in asset pricing. © 2014, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Asset pricing theory; Corwin-Schultz bid-ask spread estimate; Liquidity premium; Liquidity risk",,"Zhang, X.; Shanxi Business School, China; email: zhangxd@sxu.edu.cn",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",20441398,,,,"English","China Finance Rev.

Strongly asymmetric cross-correlation functions are empirically observed, especially in the future/stock case. We confirm the intuition that the most liquid assets (short intertrade duration, narrow bid/ask spread, small volatility, high turnover) tend to lead smaller stocks. However, the most correlated stocks are those with similar levels of liquidity. These lead/lag relationships become more and more pronounced as we zoom on significant events. We reach 60% of accuracy when forecasting the next midquote variation of the lagger using only the past information of the leader, which is significantly better than using the information of the lagger only.

However, since pioneers’ works of Chen, Kim and Kon (1975) and Amihud and Mendelson (1986) in microstructure area, systematic violations of this assumption were observed and the standard CAPM generates biased estimates of returns. The main obstacle that we face when we use CAPM with frictions is the unavailability of the observable variables that directly measure illiquidity costs, transaction costs and information costs. Microstructure literature provides many models to estimate them. We use Amihud (2002) model to estimate illiquidity costs and Lin et al. (1995) model to estimate transaction and information costs. Before a study of a sample of 40 quoted securities in Tunisian financial market, on the period of 07/02/2011 to 31/01/2013, results appear conclusive. First, we show the existence of asset pricing bias compared to the standard CAPM. Furthermore, we find a strong relation between transaction costs, information costs and illiquidity estimators and returns; thus the use of the CAPM with frictions.

In case of historical estimation, uncertainty arises through the estimator’s volatility and possible bias. In case of market implied parameters, the solution of a calibration to market data might not be unique or the numerical routine returns a local instead of a global minimum. This paper provides a new method based on convex risk measures to quantify parameter risk and to translate it into prices, extending results in Cont (Math Finance 16(3):519–547, 2006) and Lindström (Adv Decision Sci, 2010). We introduce the notion of risk-capturing functionals and prices, provided a distribution on the parameter (or model) set is available, and present explicit examples where the Average-Value-at-Risk and the entropic risk measure are used. For some classes of risk-capturing functionals, the risk-captured price preserves weak convergence of the distributions. In particular, the risk-captured price generated by the distributions of a consistent sequence of estimators converges to the true price. For asymptotically normally distributed estimators we provide large sample approximations for risk-captured prices. Following Bion-Nadal (J Math Econ 45(11):738–750, 2009); Carr et al. (J Financ Econ 62:131–167, 2001); Cherny and Madan (Int J Theor Appl Finance 13(8):1149–1177, 2010); Xu (Ann Finance 2:51–71, 2006), we interpret the risk-captured price as an ask price, reflecting aversion towards parameter risk. To acknowledge parameter risk in case of calibration to market prices, we create a parameter distribution from the pricing error function, allowing us to compare the intrinsic parameter risk of the stochastic volatility models of Heston and Barndorff-Nielsen and Shephard as well as the Variance Gamma option pricing model by pricing different exotics. © 2013, DAV / DGVFM.","Bid-ask spread; Calibration risk; Convex risk measure; Parameter risk; Risk-captured price; Risk-capturing functional",,"Scherer, M.Parkring 11, Germany; email: scherer@tum.de",,"Springer Berlin",21909733,,,,"English","Eur.

In this paper, we propose a necessary and sufficient condition for bid and ask prices of European options to be free of arbitrage, and derive from it an efficient numerical methodology to determine its satisfaction by a given set of prices. If the bid and ask prices satisfy the no-arbitrage (NA) condition, our methodology produces a vector of NA prices that lie between the bid and ask prices. Otherwise, our methodology generates a vector of arbitrage-free prices that is as close as possible, in some sense, to the bid-ask strip. The arbitrage-free prices detected by our methodology render the commonly used practice of using mid-points and then 'cleaning' arbitrage from them as unnecessary. Moreover, a vector of 'cleaned' prices obtained from mid-point prices may be outside the bid-ask spread even in an arbitrage-free market and, hence, in this case will not be representative of the current market. A new procedure of estimating implied valuation operators is also suggested here. This procedure is rooted in the economic properties of put and call prices and is based on Phillips and Taylor's approximation of a convex function. This approach is superior to common estimation techniques in that it produces an analytical expression for the implied valuation operator and is not data intensive as some other studies.

In essence, this study extends research literature related to the assessment of the asset market/liquidity risk by providing a generalized theoretical modelling underpinning that handle, from the same perspective, market and liquidity risks jointly and integrate both risks into a portfolio setting without a commensurate increase of statistical postulations. As such, we argue that market and liquidity risk components are correlated in most cases and can be integrated into one single market/liquidity framework that consists of two interrelated sub-components. The first component is attributed to the impact of adverse price movements and is modelled based on the concept of liquidity-adjusted value-at-risk framework, while the second component focuses on the risk of variation in transactions costs due to the bid-ask spreads and it attempts to measure the likelihood that it will cost more than expected to liquidate the asset position. As such, the model comprises a new approach to contemplating the impact of time-varying volatility of the bid-ask spread and its upshot on the overall asset market/liquidity risk. The modelling framework can be constructive for financial service industries in emergingeconomies and particularly in reinforcing rational economic-capital allocation in light of the aftermaths of the sub-prime financial crisis. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.","Economic-capital; Emerging markets; Financial engineering; Financial markets; Financial risk management; Financial service industries; Liquidity adjusted value at risk; Liquidity risk; Portfolio management","capital; financial crisis; financial market; financial services; risk factor; service sector; statistical analysis","Al Janabi, M.

Design/methodology/approach A two-step estimation procedure is used to estimate a regression model of a firm's information asymmetry component of cost of capital on the level of investor relations and other firm characteristics in order to control for self-selection bias. Findings As expected, a negative link between the level of investor relations and cost of capital is documented after controlling for self-selection bias, firm characteristics, and additional robustness check. Research limitations/ implications The result of the paper is based on a sample of listed Japanese electric appliance firms, and thus may not be generalized to other industries or institutional settings. Total spread, which consists of information cost, inventory holding cost, and other processing cost component, might produce measurement errors and thus bias against the results. Further researchers should endeavor to isolate information cost component from total spread. Practical implications Involving in investor relations' activities to reduce information asymmetries ultimately narrows bid-ask spread, and thus reduces cost of capital. An important implication, therefore, is that managers should treat any market participants equally by communicating to a broad spectrum of investor communities via investor relations. Originality/value The current paper contributes to the literature by modeling and explicitly controlling for self-selection bias and being the first study to investigate the association between investor relations and cost of capital for Japanese firms. © 2010 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

The motivation is that SVR features these extra capabilities at a low estimation cost. The SVR is specified by a loss function, a kernel function and a smoothing parameter. SVR models the daily U.S. dollar interest rate swap curves, from 1997 to 2001. As expected from a priori and sensibility analyses, the SVR equipped with the kernel generating a spline with an infinite number of nodes was the best performing SVR. Comparing this SVR with other models, it achieved the best cross-validation interpolation performance in controlling the bias-variance trade-off and generating the lowest error considering the desired accuracy fixed by the bid-ask spreads. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Bid-ask spread; Interest rate curves; Interest rate swaps; Support vector regression",,"Monteiro, A.

Based on extensive simulation results, we conclude that the best practice is to match firms one-to-one based on market capitalization and share price, and to test for differences between the matched pairs using a Wilcoxon signed rank test. We demonstrate that pre-sorting by industry groups or discarding apparent poor matches may reduce test power. We show that, in general, tests based on one-to-one nearest-neighbor matching have comparable power and less size distortion than alternatives that place more weight on distant firms. We find that matching without replacement can reduce size distortion when the control sample is relatively small. We highlight conditions under which matched sample estimation may be preferred to the corresponding event study. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

In additon to purely theoretical interest, this problem is of interest for applications since the problem of evaluation of integrated volatility for financial assets is an important part of financial engineering topics. In the present paper, we suggest a new approach to the above-mentioned problem. We derive an integral equation whose solution determines the value of integrated volatility. This integral equation is a typical ill-posed problem of mathematical physics. The main idea of the proposed reduction of the original problem to an ill-posed problem consists of making its solution robust with respect to anomalous values of statistical data which are generated, for example, by market microstructure effects, such as the bid-ask spread.

We estimate a bivariate generalized autoregressive intensity process for the arrival rates of informed and uninformed trades for 16 actively traded stocks over 15 years of transaction data. Our results show that both informed and uninformed trades are highly persistent, but that the uninformed arrival forecasts respond negatively to past forecasts of the informed intensity. Our estimation generates daily conditional arrival rates of informed and uninformed trades, which we use to construct forecasts of the probability of information-based trade (PIN). These forecasts are used in turn to forecast market liquidity as measured by bid-ask spreads and the price impact of orders. We observe that PINs vary across assets and over time, and most importantly that they are correlated across assets. Our analysis shows that one principal component explains much of the daily variation in PINs and that this systemic liquidity factor may be important for asset pricing. We also find that PINs tend to rise before earnings announcement days and decline afterwards. © The Author 2008.","Arrival rates; Autoregressive process; Informed trades; Liquidity; Market depth; Uninformed trades",,"Engle, R.F.; Stern School of Business, 44 West 4th Street, Tuxedo, NY 10012-1126, United States; email: rengle@stern.nyu.edu",,,14798409,,,,"English","J.

Traditional VaR approaches assume perfect markets, where an investor can buy or sell any amount of stock without causing a significant price change. Such a hypothesis is seldom verified in practice, especially in emerging markets, consequently underestimating the VaR risk measure. An attempt is made to remedy this shortcoming by first estimating the bid-ask spread components in order to calculate accurately both the endogeneous and the exogenous liquidity risk. Under this framework, the liquidation price of a position will not be the spread midpoint, but at most the bid price. The Madhavan et al. (1997) model is extended by incorporating the traded volume and find that liquidity risk, for an emerging stock market, displays an inverse U-shape pattern throughout the day. For the high-priced, high-capitalization stocks of the Athens Stock Exchange, it represents 3.40% of total market risk, while for the low capitalization ones, it is even higher at 11%. VaR measures are then adjusted for such spread variation since, neglecting such effect, leads so serious failure of VaR backtesting. © 2006 Taylor & Francis.",,"estimation method; price dynamics; stock market","Angelidis, T.; Department of Financial and Management Engineering, , Samos, Greece; email: taggel@unipi.gr",,,09603107,,,,"English","Appl.

Research in the microstructure of futures markets has lagged behind. A primary reason is that futures exchanges in the U.S. do not record bid-ask quotes, requiring these costs to be imputed from transaction price data. A reliable estimator of bid-ask spreads would significantly enhance microstructure research in futures markets. Unique intraday data from the Sydney Futures Exchange (SFE) that include both transaction prices and bid-ask spreads allow us to compare bid-ask spread estimation techniques proposed in the literature against the benchmark of actual spreads in a futures market, and thus identify the best-performing estimator. To maximize relevance, we impose all the constraints that apply in U.S. futures data to perform our estimations. We find that the four bid-ask spread estimators considered significantly underestimate the actual spreads.

Are the forecasted hedging ratios (and wealth generated) from the nested bid-ask model statistically and economically different than standard approaches? Are there times when a trader following a basic model that does not forecast outperforms a trader using the nested bid-ask model? On all counts the results are encouraging - a trader that accounts for the bid-ask spread and forecasts volatility several periods in the nested model will incur lower transactions costs and gain significantly when the market suddenly and abruptly turns.

These findings suggest that commodity futures markets have an inherently different character than financial futures markets, and therefore merit separate investigation. © 2004 Taylor and Francis Ltd.",,"commodity market; market conditions; transaction cost","Haigh, M.S.; US Commodity Futures Trading Commn., Washington, DC 20581, United States; email: mhaigh@cftc.gov",,,09603107,,,,"English","Appl.

Using time and sales data from the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) market profile data series, effective bid-ask spreads are estimated on the basis of daily and intraday measures of the Thompson-Waller and Smith-Whaley estimators. We find liquidity costs on the screen-based system vary with time and the level of floor trading activity. In particular, a one-tick market is observed just before the opening of the Chicago trading floor (6:30 to 7:30 am). However, subsequent intraday spreads exhibit the familiar ""reverse J-shaped pattern""-highest following the opening of floor trading, declining until afternoon, and then increasing until close. Meanwhile, daily spread estimates average almost a quarter-tick higher on the screen-based market relative to the one-tick spread commonly associated with open outcry. This relationship remained robust across sample time-series and conservative price-change specifications. Since the study was conducted, electronic trading has become the predominant exchange medium for financial derivatives at the CBOT, following the example set in Europe's traditional futures exchanges, e.g. France's Matif, Germany's Deutsche Bourse and the U.K.'s Liffe. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

Hausman's (1978) tests of specification confirmed that trading volume, bid-ask spread, and price volatility are jointly determined. We estimated the parameters and elasticities of trading volume, bid-ask spread, and price volatility in a three-equation structural model, using the generalized method of moments (GMM) procedure. Results indicate that there was a positive relationship between trading volume and price volatility but an inverse relationship between trading volume and bid-ask spread after we controlled for other factors. Furthermore, results show that price volatility had a positive relationship with bid-ask spread and a negative relationship with lagged trading volume. In addition, we found that the ordinary least-squares parameter estimates of each equation model were often severely underestimated in comparison with those consistent estimates obtained from the GMM estimation. Results from this study have important policy implications. Our results indicate that a transaction tax, which is analogous to a greater bid-ask spread, will reduce trading volume, although the reduction is not as great as we previously estimated. © 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

(GKN, 1991) estimators of the adverse selection and order processing cost components of the bid-ask spread are biased due to intertemporal variations in the bid-ask spread. We use alternative estimators that correct this bias and that are applicable to individual securities, and estimate these cost components empirically using data on NYSE/AMEX stocks. As expected, our results indicate that on average adverse selection costs account for approximately 50% of the bid-ask spread, sharply higher than the estimates of 8-10% obtained by GKN for NASDAQ stocks and 21% that we obtain for NYSE/AMEX stocks using GKN's estimators. We then conduct cross-sectional regressions designed primarily to determine whether adverse selection costs vary across specialists after controlling for firm size and other factors. Consistent with previously established hypotheses, we find that adverse-selection costs vary across specialists, and that this variation is related to the number of securities that the specialist handles. © 1996 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Adverse selection cost; Bid-ask spread; D82; G14; Microstructure; Order processing cost; Specialist",,,,,13547798,,,,"English","Eur.

We attack these problems by explicitly incorporating them in the construction of a generating process for observed security returns. First, we develop a procedure for “filling in” missing returns.
