The study is carried out on twenty portfolios, formed on the basis of liquidity criteria using seasonal data from 2009 to 2018. In other words, this approach is applied to analyse the target pricing model through transaction costs proxy and evaluation of the portfolios. Exploiting the proposed bid-ask spread estimator as the transaction costs proxy shows that liquidity-adjusted CCAPM explains a bigger portion of cross-sectional return changes compared to the traditional CCAPM model. In addition, the results show that disregarding transaction costs and liquidity risk may lead to an inaccurate estimate of the expected return.

This study provides a literature review of low-frequency liquidity measures with a primary focus on liquidity measurement as well as its implication on asset pricing. Based on the dimension it captures, a range of existing low-frequency measures are divided into four categories of liquidity proxies including transaction cost, volume, price impact, and multidimension-based measures. We review some well-established liquidity proxies, a new bid–ask spread estimator and price impact ratios proposed recently. Finally, we discuss how good low-frequency liquidity measures are at capturing standard liquidity benchmarks, which are constructed from high-frequency intraday data. © 2020 The Authors.

The biases and mean squared errors (MSE) of these three estimators have been derived and compared with each other asymptotically, which reveals explicitly the superior performance of HL and CHL estimators over Roll's estimator. Moreover, if the volatility is relatively small compared to the spread, the performance of the CHL estimator is superior to the HL method. Then the subsequent simulation studies and bootstrap analysis on empirical examples also verify the theoretical results. The comparison method discussed here is different from the existing literature, which usually resorts to the correlation between the bid–ask spread estimators with a benchmark calculated from high-frequency data as they compare the performance of different estimators. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Asymptotic property; Bid–ask spread; Bootstrap; Liquidity; Price range,Benchmarking; Mean square error; Asymptotic properties; Bootstrap; Comparison methods; High frequency data; Liquidity; Mean squared error; Price range; Statistical properties; Frequency estimation,"Qiu, T., Chen, G., Zhong, L.X., Wu, X.R., Dynamics of bid–ask spread return and volatility of the Chinese stock market (2012) Phys.

We address this challenge by introducing two low frequency bid-ask spread estimators using daily high and low transaction prices. The range of mid-prices is an increasing function of the sampling interval, while the bid-ask spread and the relationship between trading direction and the mid-price are not constrained by it and are therefore independent. Monte Carlo simulations and data analysis from the equity and foreign exchange markets demonstrate that these models (especially SHL2) significantly out-perform the most widely used low-frequency estimators, such as those proposed in Corwin and Schultz (2012) and most recently in Abdi and Ronaldo (2017). Using real world data we show that one of our estimators (SHL2)’s root mean square error (RMSE) is almost less than a half (even 20%) of the competitors. We illustrate how our models can be applied to deduce historical market liquidity in US, UK, Hong Kong and the Thai stock markets. Our estimator can also effectively act as a gauge for market volatility and as a measure of liquidity risk in asset pricing. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",Effective spread; High-low spread estimator; Market liquidity; Transaction cost,,"Abdi, F., Ranaldo, A., A simple estimation of Bid-Ask spreads from daily close, high, and low prices (2017), University of St. Gallen, School of Finance Research Paper 2016/04; Bandi, F.M., Russell, J.R., Separating microstructure noise from volatility (2006) Journal of Financial Economics, 79 (3), pp. 655-692; Banti, C., Phylaktis, K., Sarno, L., Global liquidity risk in the foreign exchange market (2012) Journal of International Money and Finance, 31 (2), pp. 267-291; Bleaney, M., Li, Z., The performance of bid-ask spread estimators under less than ideal conditions Michael Bleaney and Zhiyong Li less than ideal conditions (2015) Studies in Economics and Finance, 32 (1), pp. 98-127; Bleaney, M., Li, Z., A new spread estimator (2016) Review of Quantitative Finance and Accounting, 47 (1), pp. 179-211; Chen, X., Linton, O., Schneeberger, S., Yi, Y., Simple nonparametric estimators for the Bid-Ask spread in the roll model (2016) Cowles Foundation Discussion Paper No. 2033, pp. 1-59; Choi, J.Y., Salandro, D., Shastri, K., On the estimation of Bid-Ask spreads: Theory and evidence (1988) The Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis, 23 (2), pp. 219-230; Chung, K.H., Zhang, H., A simple approximation of intraday spreads using daily data (2014) Journal of Financial Markets, 17 (1), pp. 94-120; Corwin, S.A., Schultz, P., A simple way to estimate Bid-Ask spreads from daily high and low prices (2012) Journal of Finance, 67 (2), pp. 719-760; Fong, K.Y.L., Holden, C.W., Trzcinka, C.A., What are the best liquidity proxies for global research?

In recent years, with the rapid growth of algorithmic trading and program trading, the advanced information and communication technology has become an indispensable element for high-frequency traders, especially for the market makers. In addition, artificial intelligence and deep learning also plays an important role in novel financial technology (FinTech) research field. In this paper, we proposed a market making quotation strategy based on deep learning structure and practical finance domain knowledge.

The Corwin-Schultz estimator arises as an easy way to compute asymmetric information throughout daily high and low stock prices for estimating overnight and non-negative adjusted spreads. The sample consisted of Ibovespa firms from 1986 to 2014 and was analysed with time series econometrics. The findings show that the measures of spread have stationarity properties, allowing for forecasting in a period of lagged variables, besides having the property of time-varying cointegration with market-to-book ratio, debt on equity, size and return and also presenting sensibility to different periods, industries and listing segments. Thus, the Corwin-Schultz bid-ask spread estimator seems to be a valid and reliable measure for forecasting aggregate-data variables through the weighted average of firm-level variables. © 2016, ANPAD - Associacao Nacional de Pos-Graduacao e Pesquisa em Administracao.

The bid-ask spread is important for many reasons. Because spread data are not always available, many methods have been suggested for estimating the spread. Existing papers focus on the performance of the estimators either under ideal conditions or in real data. The gap between ideal conditions and the properties of real data are usually ignored. The consistency of the estimates across various sampling frequencies is also ignored. Design/methodology/approach: The estimators and the possible errors are analysed theoretically. Then we perform simulation experiments, reporting the bias, standard deviation and root mean square estimation error of each estimator. More specifically, we assess the effects of the following factors on the performance of the estimators: the magnitude of the spread relative to returns volatility, randomly varying of spreads, the autocorrelation of mid-price returns and mid-price changes caused by trade directions and feedback trading. Findings: The best estimates come from using the highest frequency of data available. The relative performance of estimators can vary quite markedly with the sampling frequency. In small samples, the standard deviation can be more important to the estimation error than bias; in large samples, the opposite tends to be true. Originality/value: There is a conspicuous lack of simulation evidence on the comparative performance of different estimators of the spread under the less than ideal conditions that are typical of real-world data. This paper aims to fill this gap. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Bid-ask spread; Estimation; Feedback trading,,"Amihud, Y., Mendelson, H., Dealership market: Market-making with inventory (1980) Journal of Financial Economics, 8 (1), pp. 31-53; Anand, A., Karagozoglu, A.K., Relative performance of bid-ask spread estimators: Futures market evidence (2006) Journal of International Financial Markets, Institutions and Money, 16 (3), pp. 231-245; ap Gwilym, O., Thomas, S., An empirical comparison of quoted and implied bid-ask spreads on futures contracts (2002) Journal of International Financial Markets, Institutions and Money, 12 (1), pp. 81-99; Bandi, F.M., Russell, J.R., Separating microstructure noise from volatility (2006) Journal of Financial Economics, 79 (3), pp. 655-692; Banti, C., Phylaktis, K., Sarno, L., Global liquidity risk in the foreign exchange market (2012) Journal of International Money and Finance, 31 (2), pp. 267-291; Berger, D.W., Chaboud, A.P., Chernenko, S.V., Howorka, E., Wright, J.H., Order flow and exchange rate dynamics in electronic brokerage system data (2008) Journal of International Economics, 75 (1), pp. 93-109; Bessembinder, H., Bid-ask spreads in the interbank foreign exchange markets (1994) Journal of Financial Economics, 35 (3), pp. 317-348; Chan, K.C., Christie, W.G., Schultz, P.H., Market structure and the intraday pattern of bid-ask spreads for nasdaq securities (1995) The Journal of Business, 68 (1), pp. 35-60; Choi, J.Y., Salandro, D., Shastri, K., On the estimation of bid-ask spreads: Theory and evidence (1988) The Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis, 23 (2), pp. 219-230; Corwin, S.A., Schultz, P., A simple way to estimate bid-ask spreads from daily high and low prices (2012) The Journal of Finance, 67 (2), pp. 719-760; Daníelsson, J., Love, R., Feedback trading (2006) International Journal of Finance & Economics, 11 (1), pp. 35-53; Daníelsson, J., Payne, R., Real trading patterns and prices in spot foreign exchange markets (2002) Journal of International Money and Finance, 21 (2), pp. 203-222; De Long, J.B., Shleifer, A., Summers, L.H., Waldmann, R.J., Positive feedback investment strategies and destabilizing rational speculation (1990) The Journal of Finance, 45 (2), pp. 379-395; Evans, M.D.D., Lyons, R.K., Order flow and exchange rate dynamics (2002) The Journal of Political Economy, 110 (1), pp. 170-180; Garman, M.B., Klass, M.J., On the estimation of security price volatilities from historical data (1980) The Journal of Business, 53 (1), pp. 67-78; George, T.J., Kaul, G., Nimalendran, M., Estimation of the bid-ask spread and its components: A new approach (1991) The Review of Financial Studies, 4 (4), pp. 623-656; Glosten, L., Milgrom, P., Bid ask and transaction prices in a specialist market with heterogeneously informed trades (1985) Journal of Financial Economics, 14 (1), pp. 71-100; Goodhart, C., Ito, T., Payne, R., One day in june 1993: A study of the working of reuters d2000-2 electronic foreign exchange trading system (1996) The Microstrttcture of Foreign Exchange Markets, , Frankel, J., Galli, G. and Giovannini, A.

The paper focusses on whether the new measure as a liquidity proxy commands a significant premium. The research helps the understanding on the validity of the Corwin-Schultz estimate as a liquidity measure. Design/methodology/approach – The authors carry out their examination based on the portfolio approach, cross-sectional regressions, and time-series regressions. For comparison, the authors also adopt other three liquidity proxies and mainly rely on the Fama-French three-factor model as the benchmark. The sample includes NYSE/AMEX/ARCA/NASDAQ ordinary common stocks over 1926-2010. Findings – The paper finds that Corwin-Schultz spread lacks significant power to predict returns either in the pre- or post-1963 period. In contrast, other liquidity measures such as the price impact of Amihud (2002), trading discontinuity of Liu (2006), and turnover show stronger return predictability than the Corwin-Schultz spread estimate. Research limitations/implications – The evidence indicates the limited ability of the Corwin-Schultz spread estimate to describe liquidity. Practical implications – The comparison of the Corwin-Schultz spread with other liquidity measures helps practitioners and academic researchers to identify the appropriate proxy. Originality/value – This paper, for the first time, provides a thorough assessment of the Corwin-Schultz spread estimate as a liquidity proxy, which distinguish from Corwin and Schultz (2012) who focus on whether their spread estimate measures transaction costs. Our study not only helps practitioners and academic researchers to select an adequate liquidity measure and an asset pricing model to use, but it also sheds light on the current debate about whether transaction costs have the first order importance in asset pricing. © 2014, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Asset pricing theory; Corwin-Schultz bid-ask spread estimate; Liquidity premium; Liquidity risk,,"Acharya, V.V., Pedersen, H., Asset pricing with liquidity risk (2005) Journal of Financial Economics, 77 (2), pp. 375-410; Amihud, Y., Illiquidity and stock returns: cross-section and time-series effects (2002) Journal of Financial Markets, 5 (1), pp. 31-56; Amihud, Y., Mendelson, H., Asset pricing and the bid-ask spread (1986) Journal of Financial Economics, 17 (2), pp. 223-249; Brennan, M.J., Chordia, T., Subrahmanyam, A., Alternative factor specifications, security characteristics, and the cross-section of expected stock returns (1998) Journal of Financial Economics, 49 (3), pp. 345-373; Corwin, S.A., Schultz, P., A simple way to estimate bid-ask spreads from daily high and low prices (2012) Journal of Finance, 67 (2), pp. 719-760; Datar, V.T., Naik, Y., Radcliffe, R., Liquidity and stock returns: an alternative test (1998) Journal of Financial Markets, 1 (2), pp. 203-219; Davis, J.L., Fama, E.F., French, K.R., Characteristics, covariances, and average returns: 1929 to 1997 (2000) Journal of Finance, 55 (1), pp. 389-406; Hasbrouck, J., Trading costs and returns for US equities: estimating effective costs from daily data (2009) Journal of Finance, 64 (3), pp. 1445-1477; Holden, C.W., New low-frequency spread measures (2009) Journal of Financial Markets, 12 (4), pp. 778-813; Lesmond, D.A., Ogden, P., Trzcinka, A., A new estimate of transaction costs (1999) Review of Financial Studies, 12 (5), pp. 1113-1141; Litzenberger, R., Ramaswamy, K., The effects of personal taxes and dividends on capital asset prices: theory and empirical evidence (1979) Journal of Financial Economics, 7 (2), pp. 163-195; Liu, W., A liquidity-augmented capital asset pricing model (2006) Journal of Financial Economics, 82 (3), pp. 6316-6371; Liu, W., (2010) Liquidity risk and asset pricing: evidence from daily data, 1926-2009, , working paper, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, November; Liu, W., Strong, N., Biases in decomposing holding period portfolio returns (2008) Review of Financial Studies, 21 (5), pp. 2243-2274; Pastor, L., Stambaugh, R.F., Liquidity risk and expected stock returns (2003) Journal of Political Economy, 111 (3), pp. 642-685; Roll, R., A simple implicit measure of the effective bid – ask spread in an efficient market (1984) Journal of Finance, 39 (4), pp. 1127-1139; Sadka, R., Momentum and post-earnings-announcement drift anomalies: the role of liquidity risk (2006) Journal of Financial Economics, 80 (2), pp. 309-349; Shumway, T., The delisting bias in CRSP data (1997) Journal of Finance, 52 (1), pp. 327-340; Chan, H., Faff, R., Asset pricing and illiquidity premium (2005) Financial Review, 40 (4), pp. 429-458; Chordia, T., Huh, S., Subrahmanyam, A., Theory-based illiquidity and asset pricing (2009) Review of Financial Studies, 22 (9), pp. 3629-3668; Fama, E.F., Kenneth, F., Common risk factors in the returns on stocks and bonds (1993) Journal of Financial Economics, 33 (1), pp. 3-56; Fama, E.F., MacBeth, D., Risk, return, and equilibrium: empirical tests (1973) Journal of Political Economy, 81 (3), pp. 607-636; Goyenko, R.Y., Holden, C.W., Trzcinka, A., Do liquidity measures measure liquidity?

This study aims to offer an innovative alternative method to estimate the transaction costs in stock trading via the implied transaction costs by using the Leland option pricing model. The effectiveness of this new approach is tested by using the S&P/ASX 200 index call options data. On the basis of the actual transaction costs estimates on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) documented by previous studies and Roll's model, the empirical results reveal that this new approach can provide a reliable transaction costs estimate on stock trading on the ASX. Furthermore, the accuracy of the implied transaction costs across option moneyness and maturity and the variation of the implied transaction costs during the recent global financial crisis period are investigated. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.",,,"Aitken, M., Frino, A., Execution costs associated with institutional trades on the Australian Stock Exchange (1996) Pacific Basin Finance Journal, 4 (1), pp. 45-58; Anand, A., Karagozoglu, A.K., Relative performance of bid-ask spread estimators: Futures market evidence (2006) Journal of International Financial Markets, Institutions and Money, 16 (3), pp. 231-245. , DOI 10.1016/j.intfin.2005.02.004, PII S104244310500048X; Atkinson, C., Alexandropoulos, C.A., Pricing a European basket option in the presence of proportional transaction costs (2006) Applied Mathematical Finance, 13 (3), pp. 191-214. , DOI 10.1080/13504860600563184, PII X8153R645084N101; (2009) Low Exercise Price Options, , http://www.asx.com.au/products/low-exercise-price-options.htm, Australian Securities Exchange (ASX). accessed 1 December 2009; Bakshi, G., Charles, C., Chen, Z., Empirical performance of alternative option pricing models (1997) Journal of Finance, 52 (5), pp. 2003-2049; Barone-Adesi, G., Engle, R.F., Mancini, L., A GARCH option pricing model with filtered historical simulation (2008) The Review of Financial Studies, 21 (3), pp. 1223-1258; Black, F., Scholes, M., The valuation of option contracts and a test of market efficiency (1972) The Journal of Finance, 27 (2), pp. 399-417; Bollen, N.P.B., Whaley, R.E., Does net buying pressure affect the shape of implied volatility functions?

In order to explore the characteristics of stock bid-ask spread in their industry and their changes over time mode. This paper uses Corwin(2010)'s new approach to estimate bid-ask spread, deal with the day's high and low price to calculate the spread, programmed and computed nearly 20 years and containing almost all of the stocks, importantly, categorized and analyzed the stock spread according to its industry property. Shanghai's spread was significantly lower than the Shenzhen's. And the spread show greater volatility when market ups or downs. However, the standard deviation of bid-ask spread in the whole time was gradually reduced. Different industries' bid-ask spread were highly relevant, but its variance were significant differences. By the impact of industrial policy, industries' bid-ask spread changed largely over the year. © 2012 IEEE.",Bid-ask spread; Implicit transaction costs; Microstructure,Bid-ask spread; Industrial policies; Market liquidity; Standard deviation; Transaction cost; Microstructure; Robotics; Industry,"Dong, F., Han, L., Empirical Study on the Effects of Transparency in Chinese Stock Market (2006) Economic Research Journal[J], (5); Qu, W., Wu, S., An Analysis of Characteristics of China s Stock Market Microstructure (2002) Economic Research Journal[J], (1); Wang, Z., Chen, P., The Adverse Selection Component of the Bid-ask Spread in Shenzhen Market:Estimation and Analyses (2006) Securities Market Herald[N], (3); He, C., Lu, Z., He, X., Cai, J., A Study on the Adverse Selection Cost of Chinese Stock Exchange (2009) Economic Research Journal[J], (2); Corwin, S., Schultz, P., A simple way to estimate bid ask spreads from daily high and low prices (2011) Forthcoming Journal of Finance; George, T.J., Kaul, G., Nimalendran, M., Estimation of the bid- ask spreads and its components: A new approach (1991) Review of Financial Studies, 4, pp. 623-656. , J; Glosten, L., Harris, L., Estimating the Components of the Bid-ask Spread (1988) Journal of Financial Economics, 21, pp. 123-142","Tian, C.; College of Economics, , Guangzhou, China; email: tiancunzhi@sina.com",,,,9.78147E+12,,,English,"Proc. - IEEE Symp.

Daily high (low) prices are almost always buy (sell) trades. Hence, the high-low ratio reflects both the stock's variance and its bid-ask spread. Although the variance component of the high-low ratio is proportional to the return interval, the spread component is not. This allows us to derive a spread estimator as a function of high-low ratios over 1-day and 2-day intervals. The estimator is easy to calculate, can be applied in a variety of research areas, and generally outperforms other low-frequency estimators. © 2012 The American Finance Association.",,,"Amihud, Y., Illiquidity and stock returns: Cross-section and time-series effects (2002) Journal of Financial Markets, 5, pp. 31-56; Amihud, Y., Lauterbach, B., Mendelson, H., The value of trading consolidation: Evidence from the exercise of warrants (2003) Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis, 38, pp. 829-846; Antunovich, P., Sarkar, A., Fifteen minutes of fame?

Based on an ability to reflect simulated data from Roll's spread model, we assess the effectiveness of conventional and Bayesian bid-ask spread estimators under different market conditions. Conventional serial covariance and absolute price change spread estimators appear to be biased. Hasbrouck's Bayesian estimator generates small costs of liquidity whose values depend on the correlation and noise in the data. The absolute value Bayesian estimator is precise and works well under conditions of high levels of noise and correlation usually found in agricultural futures markets. Using data from live cattle (LC) and lean hog (LH) contracts, we find similar patterns of performance that produce economically meaningful cost of liquidity differences. © 2011 International Association of Agricultural Economists.",Bayesian spread estimator; Cost of liquidity; Futures markets; Gibbs sampler,agricultural economics; agricultural market; Bayesian analysis; cattle; cost-benefit analysis; data set; estimation method; future prospect; market conditions; noise; numerical model; sampler; Bos; Suidae,"Anand, A., Karagozoglu, A., Relative performance of bid-ask spread estimators: Futures market evidence (2006) J.

Researchers have addressed questions regarding the factors that influence bid-ask spreads and the relationship between spreads and risk, return and liquidity. Intraday data have been used to measure the effective spread, and researchers have been able to refine the concepts of liquidity to include the price impact of transactions on a trade-by-trade analysis. The growth in the creation of tax-transparent securities has greatly enhanced the visibility of securitized real estate, and has naturally led to the question of whether the increased visibility of real estate has caused market liquidity to change. Although the growth in the public market for securitized real estate has occurred in international markets, it has not been accompanied by universal publication of transaction data. Therefore, this article develops an aggregate daily data-based test for liquidity and applies the test to U.S. data in order to check for consistency with the results of prior intraday analysis. If the two approaches produce similar results, we can apply the same technique to markets in which less detailed data are available and offer conclusions on the liquidity of a wider set of markets. © 2007 American Real Estate and Urban Economics Association.",,,"Acharya, V., Pedersen, L., Asset Pricing with Liquidity Risk (2005) Journal of Financial Economics, 77, pp. 375-410. , and; Amihud, Y., Illiquidity and Stock Returns: Cross-section and Time-series Effects (2002) Journal of Financial Markets, 5, pp. 31-56; Bessembinder, H., Kaufman, H.M., A Comparison of Trade Execution Costs for NYSE and NASDAQ-Listed Stocks (1997) Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis, 32, pp. 387-407. , and; Boothe, P., Exchange Rate Risk and the Bid-Ask Spread: A Seven Country Comparison (1988) Economic Inquiry, 26, pp. 485-492; Brennan, M.J., Subrahmanyam, A., Investment Analysis and Price Formation in Securities Markets (1996) Journal of Financial Economics, 38, pp. 361-381. , and; Brounen, D., Eichholtz, P., Ling, D.C., (2007) The Liquidity of Property Shares: An International Comparison., , Gainesville, FL: Bergstrom Center for Real Estate Studies, University of Florida; Capozza, D.R., Hendershott, P.H., MacK, C., An Anatomy of Price Dynamics in Illiquid Markets: Analysis and Evidence from Local Housing Markets (2004) Real Estate Economics, 32, pp. 1-32. , and; Chalmers, J., Kadlec, G., An Empirical Examination of the Amortized Spread (1998) Journal of Financial Economics, 48, pp. 159-188. , and; Chan, K.C., Lakonishok, J., Institutional Equity Trading Costs: NYSE Versus NASDAQ (1997) The: Journal of Finance, 52, pp. 713-735. , and; Chordia, T., Roll, R., Subrahmanyam, A., Commonality in Liquidity (2000) Journal of Financial Economics, 56, pp. 3-28. , and; Chordia, T., Roll, R., Subrahmanyam, A., Market Liquidity and Trading Activity (2001) The Journal of Finance, 56, pp. 501-530. , and; Chung, K.H., Van Ness, B.F., Van Ness, R.A., Limit Orders and the Bid-Ask Spread (1999) Journal of Financial Economics, 53, pp. 255-287. , and; Clark, P.K., A Subordinate Stochastic Process Model with Finite Variance for Speculative Prices (1973) Econometrica, 41, pp. 135-155; Clayton, J., MacKinnon, G., Measuring and Explaining Changes in REIT Liquidity: Moving beyond the Bid-Ask Spread (2000) Real Estate Economics, 28, pp. 89-115. , and; Cole, R., (1998) Changes in REIT Liquidity 1990-94: The Role of New REITs, , Paper presented at the 1998 AREUEA meeting, Chicago; Escribano, A., Pascual, R., Asymmetries in Bid and Ask Responses to Innovations in the Trading Process (2005) Empirical Economics, 30, pp. 913-946. , and; Glosten, L.R., Harris, L.E., Estimating the Components of the Bid/Ask Spread (1998) Journal of Financial Economics, 21, pp. 123-142. , and; Gwilym, O., Clare, A., Thomas, S., Price Clustering and Bid-Ask Spreads in International Bond Futures (1998) International Financial Markets, Institutions and Money, 8, pp. 377-391. , and; Holthausen, R.W., Leftwich, R.W., Mayers, D., The Effect of Large Block Transactions on Security Prices: A Cross-Sectional Analysis (1987) Journal of Financial Economics, 19, pp. 237-267. , and; Huang, R.D., Stoll, H.R., Dealer Versus Auction Markets: A Paired Comparison of Execution Costs on NASDAQ and the NYSE (1996) Journal of Financial Economics, 4, pp. 313-357. , and; Karpoff, J.M., The Relation between Price Changes and Trading Volume: A Survey (1987) Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis, 22, pp. 109-126; Kluger, B.D., Miller, N.G., Measuring Real Estate Liquidity (1990) AREUEA Journal, 18, pp. 145-159. , and; Kyle, A., Continuous Auctions and Insider Trading (1985) Econometrica, 53, pp. 1315-1335; Lin, J.C., Sanger, G.C., Booth, G.G., Trade Size and Components of the Bid-Ask Spread (1995) Review of Financial Studies, 8, pp. 1153-1183. , and; Madhaven, A., Sofianos, G., An Empirical Analysis of NYSE Specialist Trading (1998) Journal of Financial Economics, 48, pp. 189-210. , and; Nelling, E., Mahoney, J., Hildebrand, T., Goldstein, M., Real Estate Investment Trusts, Small Stocks and Bid-Ask Spreads (1995) Real Estate Economics, 23, pp. 45-63. , and; Rogers, L.C.G., Satchell, S.E., Yoon, Y., Are Stock Prices Driven by the Volume of Trade?

Research in the microstructure of futures markets has lagged behind. A primary reason is that futures exchanges in the U.S. do not record bid-ask quotes, requiring these costs to be imputed from transaction price data. A reliable estimator of bid-ask spreads would significantly enhance microstructure research in futures markets. Unique intraday data from the Sydney Futures Exchange (SFE) that include both transaction prices and bid-ask spreads allow us to compare bid-ask spread estimation techniques proposed in the literature against the benchmark of actual spreads in a futures market, and thus identify the best-performing estimator. To maximize relevance, we impose all the constraints that apply in U.S. futures data to perform our estimations. We find that the four bid-ask spread estimators considered significantly underestimate the actual spreads. However, simple moments-based estimators perform better in predicting spreads. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

A clear-cut MA(1)-model for the mean of the return series, and a GARCH(1,1)-model for the variance, are found. Basically, Roll's model is used, but three different methods of calculating the first-order autocovariance are suggested. Each of these in turn produces three possible ways of estimating the effective bid-ask spread. First, Roll's original autocovariance estimate is used. Second, the autocovariance is calculating using the parameters of an estimated MA(1) model. Third, the autocovariance is obtained from the parameters of a joint MA(1)-GARCH(1,1) model. By means of bootstrapping the standard error of the bid-ask spread estimates are found. It is shown that the gain in efficiency, measured by the relative difference in the standard error of the estimates, is 29% when going from method one to method two, but only 1% when going from method two to method three. These results indicate that the extra gain in efficiency obtained by taking account of the MA(1) structure of the data is noteworthy, but the gain when incorporating the GARCH-effects is negligible. © 1999, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Effective spread estimation; Time series models,,"Bollerslev, T., Generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (1986) Journal of Econometrics, 31, pp. 307-327; Bollerslev, T., Wooldridge, J.M., Quasi-maximum likelihood estimation and inference in dynamic models with time-varying covariances (1992) Econometric Reviews, 11, pp. 143-172; Chang, C.W., Chang, J.S.K., An implict measure of the effective bid-ask spread: A note (1993) The Journal of Financial Research, 16, pp. 71-75; Choi, J.Y., Salandro, D., Shastri, K., On the estimation of bid-ask spreads: Theory and evidence (1988) Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis, 23, pp. 219-230; Efron, B., The 1977 Reitz Lecture, Boostrap methods: Another look at the Jackknife (1979) The Annals of Statistics, 7, pp. 1-26; George, J.G., Kaul, G., Nimalendran, M., Estimation of the bid-ask spread and Its components: A new approach (1991) The Review of Financial Studies, 4, pp. 623-656; Hamilton, J.L., The dealer and market concepts of bid-ask spread: A comparison for NASDAQ Stocks (1991) The Journal of Financial Research, 14, pp. 129-139; Harris, L., Statistical properties of the roll serial covariance bid/ask spread estimator (1990) The Journal of Finance, 45, pp. 579-590; Hsia, C.C., Fuller, B.R., Kao, G.E., A modified method for Inferring the effective bid-ask spread from security returns (1994) Journal of Business Finance & Accounting, 21, pp. 243-253; Nyholm, K., Estimation of the bid/ask spread on Danish stocks, and evaluation of Roll's estimator (1997) Applied Financial Economics, 7, pp. 605-610; Roll, R., A simple Implicit measure of the effective bid-ask spread In an efficient market (1984) The Journal of Finance, 39, pp. 1127-1139; Smith, T., Whaley, R.E., Estimating the effective bid/ask spread from the time and sales data (1994) The Journal of Futures Markets, 14, pp. 437-455; Stoll, H.R., Alternative views of market making (1985) Market Making and the Changing Structure of the Securities Industry, , Amihud Y., Ho T., Schwartz R., (eds), Lexington, MA: Lexington Books,.

These findings may be due to the effects of time-variation in expected returns. Although purging the effects of time-varying expected returns yields more reasonable results, the bid-ask spread estimates from daily and weekly returns are still materially different. We present a method that avoids the need for removing the effects of time-varying expected returns by using a spread estimator developed directly for a correlated value innovation process. The new spread estimator not only yields more reasonable estimates of the bid-ask spread than the Roll (1984) model, but the spread estimates from daily and weekly returns are almost equal. © 1998 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Bid-ask spread; Serial covariance,,"Amihud, Y., Mendelson, H., Trading mechanisms and stock returns: An empirical investigation (1987) Journal of Finance, 42, pp. 533-553; Bhattacharya, M., (1986) Direct tests of bid/ask models, , Working Paper, Graduate School of Business.

Noise explains why serial covariance estimates are often positive in annual samples of daily and weekly returns. Small sample estimator bias partially explains why weekly estimates are more negative than daily estimates. Noise causes the Roll spread estimator to be severely biased by Jensen's inequality. The French‐Roll adjusted variance estimator is unbiased but noisy. Empirical tests confirm the major implications. 1990 The American Finance Association,,,"Amihud, Haim, Trading mechanisms and stock returns: An empirical investigation (1987) The Journal of Finance, 42, pp. 533-553; Bhattacharya, (1986), Direct tests of bid/ask models, Working Paper, Graduate School of Business, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor; Choi, J.Y., Dan, Kuldeep, On the estimation of bid‐ask spreads: Theory and evidence (1988) The Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis, 23, pp. 219-230; French, Richard, Stock return variances: The arrival of information and reaction of traders (1986) Journal of Financial Economics, 17, pp. 5-26; Glosten, Components of the bid‐ask spread and the statistical properties of transaction prices (1987) The Journal of Finance, 42, pp. 1293-1307; Harris, (1988), Estimation of ‘true’ stock price variances and bid‐ask spreads from discrete observations, Working Paper, University of Southern California, Los Angeles; Harris, A day‐end transaction price anomaly, 1989a (1989) The Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis, 24, pp. 29-45; Harris, (1989), The power of the Roll serial covariance bid/ask spread estimator, Working Paper, University of Southern California, Los Angeles; Hasbrouck, Thomas, Order arrival, quote behavior, and the return‐generating process (1987) The Journal of Finance, 42, pp. 1035-1048; Karpoff, Ralph, Short‐term trading around ex‐dividend days: Additional evidence (1988) Journal of Financial Economics, 21, pp. 291-298; McInish, Robert, (1988), An analysis of transactions data for the Toronto Stock Exchange: Return patterns and the end‐of‐day effect, Working Paper, University of Texas, Arlington; Ohlson, Stephen, Volatility increases subsequent to stock splits: An empirical aberration (1985) Journal of Financial Economics, 14, pp. 251-266; Oldfield, Richard, Robert, An autoregressive jump process for common stock returns (1977) Journal of Financial Economics, 5, pp. 389-418; Porter, (1988), Trading within the spread: An examination of interday and intraday behavior, Working Paper, Marquette University, Milwaukee; Richardson, Tom, (1988), On tests for serial dependency of returns, Working Paper, Stanford University, Stanford; Roll, A simple implicit measure of the effective bid‐ask spread in an efficient market (1984) The Journal of Finance, 39, pp. 1127-1139; Terry, (1988), End of the day returns and the bid‐ask spread, Working Paper, Stanford University, Stanford","HARRIS, L.",,,221082,,,,English,J.
